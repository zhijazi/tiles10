# Tiles 10

A (very early) WIP of a "Window Manager" for Windows 10 written in Rust.

## WIP

This project is very much incomplete, and still lacks much of the functionality expected from a WM. It started off as a proof-of-concept while learning more about Rust and tinkering with the winapi-rs crate. Functionality that seems interesting to implement is kind of being plugged in as I go along, so expect things to move around often as I learn what works and what doesn't.
