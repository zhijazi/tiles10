# Tiles 10

A (very early) WIP of a "Window Manager" for Windows 10 written in Rust.

## WIP

This project is still in very early stages of development, from core tiling code to convenient shortcuts. This project started off as a proof-of-concept while learning more about Rust and tinkering with the winapi-rs crate. I found myself continously coming back to this project and plugging in new functionality that seemed interesting to implement. I'm unsure if the project will ever leave "early stages of development," but seems interesting enough to continue expanding on as I learn more
about Rust.
